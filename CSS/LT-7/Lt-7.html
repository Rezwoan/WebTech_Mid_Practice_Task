        <h1>Why Web Performance Matters</h1>

        <p>
            Fast, responsive websites feel better to use and keep visitors engaged for longer. When pages load quickly,
            users are more likely to keep reading, interact with content, and return in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern web apps ship a lot of JavaScript, images, and style resources. Without careful optimization, all
            of this adds extra weight that slows down each page view. Techniques like code splitting, image compression,
            and caching can dramatically reduce loading time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Performance is even more important on mobile devices. Users might be on slow networks or older phones where
            every kilobyte and every render pass matters. Lightweight pages help save data, battery, and time.

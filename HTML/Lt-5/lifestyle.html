                <p>
                    With Dhaka ranked as the world&apos;s second most polluted city, residents are adjusting their daily
                    routines around air‑quality alerts. Many people now check pollution levels before leaving home,
                    children&apos;s outdoor activities are being cut back and health experts are seeing more patients with
                    breathing problems on days when the smog is thickest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors advise wearing proper masks, avoiding outdoor exercise and keeping indoor air as clean as
                    possible, but say long‑term solutions will require stricter controls on brick kilns, traffic emissions
                    and construction dust.

                <h3>Heatwaves hit health and incomes across Bangladesh</h3>
                <p><small>Published: August 29, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    New research suggests Bangladesh endured dozens of extra days of extreme heat between mid‑2024 and
                    mid‑2025, a shift scientists attribute to human‑driven climate change. For low‑income residents,
                    especially those living in crowded urban neighbourhoods, the hotter days translate into higher medical
                    costs, lost work hours and rising electricity bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Community organisations are calling for more shaded public spaces, cooling centres and early‑warning
                    systems so that people can better prepare for dangerous heat, while researchers warn that heat stress
                    will only intensify without rapid cuts in global emissions.

                <h3>Bangladesh marks World One Health Day with call for collaboration</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 11, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh has joined countries around the world in celebrating World One Health Day 2025, highlighting
                    the links between human, animal and environmental health. At events in Dhaka, officials and health
                    experts stressed that preventing future pandemics and tackling antimicrobial resistance require doctors,
                    veterinarians and environmental scientists to work more closely together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The One Health approach is also being promoted in efforts to improve food safety and protect
                    biodiversity, with national institutions pledging to strengthen data sharing and joint surveillance of
                    emerging health threats.

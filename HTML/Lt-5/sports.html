                <h3>Bangladesh crush Ireland by 217 runs to sweep Test series</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 23, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh completed a 2–0 Test series sweep over Ireland with a commanding 217‑run win at the
                    Sher‑e‑Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur. Chasing a target of 509, Ireland were bowled out
                    for 291 despite a stubborn unbeaten 71 from Curtis Campher, who batted through the morning session.

                    Left‑arm spinner Taijul Islam reached the milestone of 250 Test wickets and finished the match with
                    eight wickets, while Hasan Murad cleaned up the tail with two wickets in two balls to seal victory.
                    Earlier, Mushfiqur Rahim scored a century in his 100th Test and Liton Das and Mominul Haque produced
                    big fifties as Bangladesh piled on 476 in the first innings before declaring a second‑innings 297‑4.

                <h3>Ireland stun Bangladesh in opening T20 in Chattogram</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 28, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    Ireland ended a long winless run in Twenty20 internationals with a 39‑run victory over Bangladesh in
                    the first match of their three‑game series at the Bir Sreshtho Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium
                    in Chattogram. The visitors posted 181 for four, powered by an unbeaten half‑century from Harry
                    Tector, before restricting Bangladesh to 142 for nine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh now face pressure to respond quickly in the remaining two matches of the series, with team
                    management likely to review both batting order and death‑over plans after the defeat.

                    Bangladesh&apos;s under‑21 national hockey team have embarked on a historic World Cup campaign, taking
                    part in the Junior Hockey World Cup against some of the sport&apos;s traditional powerhouses. Drawn
                    into a challenging group, the young side face a steep learning curve but say they are determined to
                    show that Bangladesh belongs on the world stage.

                    Officials from the Bangladesh Hockey Federation describe the tournament as a key step in developing a
                    new generation of players, with the experience expected to feed directly into future senior squads and
                    regional competitions.

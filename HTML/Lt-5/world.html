                    A Dhaka special court has found former prime minister Sheikh Hasina guilty in three corruption cases
                    tied to the allocation of plots in the government&apos;s Purbachal New Town project. Prosecutors said
                    she and her family wrongly obtained land by misusing her position, while the court ordered three
                    consecutive seven‑year prison terms for Hasina and shorter sentences for her son and daughter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hasina, who was toppled last year and later fled to India, has already received a separate death
                    sentence over a violent crackdown on protesters. Her Awami League party dismisses the charges as
                    politically motivated, and international rights groups have raised concerns about whether she has had
                    a fair chance to defend herself.

                <h3>India examines Bangladesh request to extradite Hasina</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 26, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    India&apos;s foreign ministry says it is reviewing a formal request from Bangladesh to extradite
                    Sheikh Hasina, who has been living in exile there since August 2024. Dhaka renewed the request after
                    she was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity linked to last year&apos;s student uprising
                    and later to 21 years in prison in the Purbachal land cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Officials in New Delhi say the request is being processed under India&apos;s legal procedures and
                    have so far declined to say how long that review may take. The case has added a new layer of
                    complexity to relations between the two neighbours at a time when Bangladesh is preparing for new
                    elections under an interim government.

                <h3>World Bank: private sector key to climate resilience in Bangladesh</h3>
                <p><small>Published: November 24, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    A new World Bank report warns that South Asia is on the front line of the climate crisis and singles
                    out Bangladesh as one of the most vulnerable countries in the region. By 2030, nearly nine in ten
                    people in South Asia could be exposed to periods of extreme heat, while about a quarter may face a
                    high risk of severe flooding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The report argues that governments alone cannot finance the needed protection and calls for a major
                    increase in private investment in areas such as resilient infrastructure, renewable energy and climate
                    smart agriculture. In Bangladesh, the Bank says stronger collaboration between the state, local
                    business and international investors is essential to protect lives and jobs as climate impacts
                    intensify.

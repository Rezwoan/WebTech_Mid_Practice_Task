                <p>
                    A massive fire tore through the Korail slum in Dhaka on Tuesday evening, destroying rows of tin-roofed
                    shanties and leaving thousands of residents without shelter. The blaze ripped through one of the
                    capital's largest informal settlements, wedged between the affluent Gulshan and Banani neighbourhoods,
                    sending flames and smoke high into the night sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fire officials say at least 19 fire engines battled the blaze for hours but faced heavy traffic and
                    narrow lanes that forced crews to drag hoses by hand deep into the settlement. Early reports indicate
                    that more than a thousand homes were damaged or destroyed, though authorities have not reported any
                    deaths. Many of the families living in Korail are low‑income workers and climate migrants now sifting
                    through the ashes for anything they can save.

                <p>
                    A Dhaka special court has sentenced ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to 21 years in prison
                    in three corruption cases over plots of government land in the Purbachal New Town project. The judge
                    ordered three separate seven‑year terms to be served consecutively, saying Hasina and her family
                    abused state power to obtain plots they were not eligible for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her son Sajeeb Wazed and daughter Saima Wazed each received five‑year sentences in one of the cases.
                    All three verdicts were delivered in absentia as Hasina has been living in exile in India since being
                    forced from office last year. Earlier in November she was also sentenced to death in a separate trial
                    over a deadly crackdown on a student‑led uprising, a process her party and human rights groups say
                    lacks basic guarantees of fairness.

                <h2>Dhaka ranked second most polluted city in the world</h2>
                <p><small>Published: November 24, 2025</small></p>
                <img src="https://networkbangladesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/b006040460a5500287cf031efa516a91-6845002d186e7-1068x600.webp" alt="Smog hanging over Dhaka city during severe air pollution" width="320">
                <p>
                    Dhaka has been ranked the world&apos;s second most polluted city in a real‑time global index, with an
                    Air Quality Index reading around 225 and levels stuck in the “very unhealthy” range. Monitoring
                    stations across neighbourhoods such as Eastern Housing, Kalyanpur and Goran all reported concentrations
                    well above safe limits as haze continued to blanket the capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The air‑quality platform IQAir has urged residents to wear masks outdoors, avoid exercise in the open
                    air and keep windows closed when possible. Public health experts warn that long‑term exposure to this
                    level of pollution increases the risk of heart and lung disease, particularly for children, older
                    adults and outdoor workers.
